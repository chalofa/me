# Hi, I'm Gonzalo, _aka "Chalo"_

## Let’s Connect

I'm always interested in hearing about new opportunities, discussing technology, or swapping stories about product development.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/chalofa) or drop me a message at `chalo.fa@g m a i l`.


## About Me

I'm a software engineer and leader with over 15 years of experience building and scaling web applications.  
I've spent more than 10 of those years leading and guiding engineering teams, most recently at [RoverPass.com](https://www.roverpass.com/), where I helped drive real-time booking systems, inventory management & distribution, and continuous product improvements.

## My Approach

I believe in balancing strong technical foundations with a user-focused mindset.  
I've worked extensively with Ruby on Rails, React.js, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL and DevOps practices—ensuring robust, secure, and scalable platforms. I prioritize collaborative environments where engineers can learn from each other, adopt clean coding standards, and continuously improve.

## Outside of Work

When I'm not coding or leading teams, I enjoy watching NFL games, playing Padel (my new hobbie) and exploring new tech trends, and occasionally dabbling in side projects that let me experiment with emerging frameworks and tools.
